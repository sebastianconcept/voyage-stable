(name 'Voyage-Mongo-Magritte-HolgerHansPeterFreyther.2' message 'First try at adding consistency/writeConcernTo allow read after write, we will need to make sure that the write has succeeded. This is the first attempt at adding such consistency measures. It can be applied either globally or per collection. There is currently no way to override the collection setting.  Separate insert, update and remove because different consistency requirements could exist.Starting with MongoDB 2.6 we can optimize this further but upstream is looking at it as well.' id '9f42000d-95e6-4690-8a8a-749fcef63a8d' date '14 May 2016' time '11:22:18.232996 pm' author 'HolgerHansPeterFreyther' ancestors ((name 'Voyage-Mongo-Magritte-EstebanLorenzano.1' message 'version bump
