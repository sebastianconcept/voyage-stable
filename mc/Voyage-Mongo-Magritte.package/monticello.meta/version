This is the first attempt at adding such consistency measures. It can be applied either globally or per collection. There is currently no way to override the collection setting.  Separate insert, update and remove because different consistency requirements could exist.Starting with MongoDB 2.6 we can optimize this further but upstream is looking at it as well.
